# beabee frontend

This is the new beabee frontend, it will slowly replace the old user interface
and [beabee/beabee](https://github.com/beabee-communityrm/beabee) will become a pure API.

To set up:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
npm install
```

You can use the default settings in `.env.example` which point to the dev API.

To start development:

```sh
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:8080
